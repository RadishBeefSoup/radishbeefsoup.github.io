### Course 1：Introduction and Proofs


A 'proof' is a method to ascertaining the truth.
A mathematical proof is a verification of a proposition by a chain of logical deductions from a set of axioms.

Def: An implication p=>q is true if p is false or q is ture.(Truth Table)

Def: A 'proposition' is  a statement that is either true or false.
E.g.: 2+3=5 

Def: An 'Axiom' is  a proposition that is 'assumed' to be true.
E.g.: a=b, b=c, then a=c

You have to make assumptions in math, because you start with axioms.
The idea is that when you do a proof, anybody who agrees with your assumptions can follow your proof and they have to agree with your conclusion.

Axioms should be
1. consistent
2. complete
Def: A set of axioms is consistent if no proposition can be proved both true and false.
Def: A set of axioms is complete if it can be used to prove evet proposition is either true or false.

if you want consistency, there will be facts that you will never be able to prove.
