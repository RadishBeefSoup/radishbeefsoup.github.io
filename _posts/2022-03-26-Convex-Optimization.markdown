# Course 1ï¼šIntroduction

1. Least square 
2. Linear Programing
3. Convex Optimization

## Course goal and topics
### Goals:
1. recognize problems as convex optimization problems
2. develop code for problems
3. characterize optimal solution, give limits of performance

### Topics 
1. convex sets, functions, optimization problems
2. examples and applications
3. algorithms

## Nonlinear optimization
traditional techniques for general nonconvex problems involve compromises 

### local optimization methods
find a point that minimize $f_{0}$ among feasible points near it
fast, can handle large problems
require initial guess
provide no information about distance to (global) optimum

### global optimization methods
find the (global) solution
worst-case algorithms are often based on solving convex subproblems

these algorithms are oftern based on solving convex subproblems
